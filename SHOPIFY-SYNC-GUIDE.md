# Shopify Order Sync for Employee Merchandise Tracking

## ‚úÖ What Was Built

A complete Shopify order sync system to track employee merchandise purchases for your 90-day charge-back policy.

### üéØ Problem Solved
- Manually importing employee merchandise purchases was tedious
- Need to track purchases for employees who leave within 90 days
- Hard to see which employees have outstanding merchandise charges

### ‚ú® Solution
Automatic sync of Shopify orders to employee records, matching by email address.

## üöÄ How to Use

### Step 1: Access the Merchandise Section
1. Go to https://www.pandaadmin.com/employee.html
2. Login with admin credentials
3. Click "üõçÔ∏è Merchandise" tab

### Step 2: Sync Shopify Orders
1. Click the **"Sync Shopify Orders"** button (yellow/warning button)
2. Wait for the sync to complete (usually 5-10 seconds)
3. See the success message: "‚úÖ Successfully synced X Shopify orders!"
4. Merchandise table automatically refreshes with new data

### Step 3: Review Synced Orders
- Shopify orders show a **Shopify badge**
- Order details include "[Shopify #1234] Item Name"
- Values are automatically calculated
- Status reflects fulfillment (Pending/Shipped)

## üìä What Gets Synced

### From Shopify to Employee Record:
- **Customer Email** ‚Üí Matches employee email
- **Order Number** ‚Üí Stored as `shopify_order_number`
- **Line Items** ‚Üí Added to `merch_requested` field
- **Total Price** ‚Üí Added to `merchandise_value`
- **Fulfillment Status** ‚Üí Sets `merch_sent` (Yes/No)
- **Order Date** ‚Üí Stored as `shopify_order_date`

### Example Before Sync:
```
Employee: John Doe (john@pandaexteriors.com)
Merch Requested: [empty]
Merchandise Value: $0.00
```

### Example After Sync:
```
Employee: John Doe (john@pandaexteriors.com)
Merch Requested: [Shopify #1234] GAF 2025 Polo - Black (x2), GAF Cap (x1)
Merchandise Value: $85.00
Status: Shipped
```

## üîß Technical Details

### API Endpoint
**POST** `/sync-shopify-merchandise`

### How It Works:
1. **Fetch Orders**: Gets last 50 orders from Shopify GraphQL API
2. **Get Employees**: Loads all employees from DynamoDB
3. **Match by Email**: Creates email ‚Üí employee mapping
4. **Update Records**: For each matching order:
   - Appends order details to existing merchandise
   - Adds order value to total
   - Updates fulfillment status
   - Stores Shopify order metadata
5. **Return Results**: Shows synced count and any errors

### Shopify API Connection
- **Store**: `e0a6e2.myshopify.com` (pandaexteriors)
- **Access Token**: Stored securely in Lambda function
- **API Version**: 2023-10
- **Query Type**: GraphQL
- **Orders Fetched**: Last 50 orders

### Employee Matching
Orders are matched to employees by **email address**:
- Shopify customer email must match employee email exactly
- Case-insensitive matching
- Unmatched orders are reported but not synced

## üìã Sync Results

### Success Message:
```
‚úÖ Successfully synced 12 Shopify orders!
```

### With Warnings:
```
‚úÖ Successfully synced 10 Shopify orders!
‚ö†Ô∏è 2 orders could not be matched to employees
```

### Common Reasons for Unmatched Orders:
1. Customer email doesn't match any employee email
2. Order has no customer email
3. Customer is not an employee (regular customer order)

## üéØ 90-Day Charge-Back Policy

### Use Case:
When an employee leaves within 90 days, you need to know:
- What merchandise they received
- Total value to charge back
- When items were shipped

### How to Track:
1. **View Merchandise**: Click employee name to see full details
2. **Check Value**: See `merchandise_value` column
3. **Review Items**: See all items in `merch_requested`
4. **Check Date**: See when items were shipped
5. **Calculate Charge**: Use total value for charge-back

### Example Scenario:
```
Employee: Jane Smith
Hire Date: September 1, 2025
Termination Date: November 15, 2025
Days Employed: 75 days (< 90)

Merchandise Received:
- [Shopify #5678] Safety Vest ($45)
- [Shopify #5892] Work Boots ($120)
Total Value: $165.00

Action: Charge back $165.00 from final paycheck
```

## üîÑ Sync Frequency

### Recommended Schedule:
- **Weekly**: Sync once per week to catch new orders
- **Before Terminations**: Always sync before processing a termination
- **After Bulk Orders**: Sync after company-wide merchandise distributions

### Manual Sync Only:
- System does NOT auto-sync
- You control when to sync
- Prevents accidental overwrites
- Allows review of orders first

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Data Handling:
1. **Appends, Doesn't Replace**: New orders are added to existing merchandise records
2. **No Duplicates Checking**: Re-syncing the same order will create duplicates
3. **No Order Deletion**: Synced orders cannot be removed automatically
4. **Manual Entry Preserved**: Hand-entered merchandise is kept

### Best Practices:
1. ‚úÖ Sync regularly (weekly)
2. ‚úÖ Review unmatched orders
3. ‚úÖ Verify employee emails match Shopify
4. ‚úÖ Export data before major syncs (backup)
5. ‚ùå Don't sync multiple times without checking
6. ‚ùå Don't rely solely on auto-sync (always review)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Sync failed" Error
**Solution**: Check Lambda logs and verify Shopify API credentials

### Problem: No Orders Synced
**Possible Causes**:
- No new orders in Shopify
- All order emails don't match employees
- Shopify API credentials expired

### Problem: Wrong Employee Matched
**Cause**: Multiple employees with same email
**Solution**: Ensure each employee has unique email

### Problem: Values Doubled
**Cause**: Synced same orders twice
**Solution**: Manually edit employee record to remove duplicates

## üìû Support

### Check Sync Logs:
```bash
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/panda-employee-dashboard --region us-east-2 --follow
```

### Test Shopify Connection:
1. Go to Shopify Admin
2. Check API credentials under: Apps > Develop apps
3. Verify access token has `read_orders` permission

### Verify Employee Emails:
1. Export employee list
2. Check email addresses match Shopify customers
3. Update any mismatches
