# Deploy Updated Dashboard to mypandapoints.com

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

The live mypandapoints.com dashboard had several issues that have now been resolved:

### Issues Fixed:
1. ❌ **CORS Error**: `/employee-transactions` endpoint didn't exist
2. ❌ **404 Error**: Wrong API endpoint being called
3. ❌ **Missing Gift Card Codes**: Transactions didn't show gift card codes
4. ❌ **Wrong Stats**: Redeemed points not displayed correctly

### Now Working:
1. ✅ **Correct API Calls**: Uses `/points-history?employee_id=X`
2. ✅ **Gift Card Codes Displayed**: Shows codes in transaction history
3. ✅ **Accurate Stats**: Lifetime, Redeemed, and Available all correct
4. ✅ **No CORS Errors**: API calls work properly

## 📁 File to Deploy

**File**: `mypandapoints-dashboard.html`
**Deploy To**: https://mypandapoints.com/dashboard.html

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Direct File Upload (Recommended)
1. Log into your web hosting control panel (cPanel, FTP, etc.)
2. Navigate to the mypandapoints.com public_html directory
3. **Backup the current** `dashboard.html` file (rename to `dashboard.html.backup`)
4. Upload `mypandapoints-dashboard.html` as `dashboard.html`
5. Test at https://mypandapoints.com/dashboard.html

### Option 2: Git Deployment (if using auto-deploy)
If mypandapoints.com auto-deploys from this Git repository:

```bash
# The file is already in the repo at:
/mypandapoints-dashboard.html

# On your web server, rename/copy it to dashboard.html:
cp mypandapoints-dashboard.html dashboard.html
```

### Option 3: Manual Copy/Paste
1. Open `mypandapoints-dashboard.html` locally
2. Copy all contents
3. Edit the live `dashboard.html` on your server
4. Paste and save

## 🔧 What Changed in the Code

### API Endpoint Changes:
```javascript
// OLD (broken):
fetch(`${API_URL}/employee-transactions?email=${email}`)

// NEW (working):
fetch(`${API_URL}/points-history?employee_id=${employee_id}`)
```

### Employee Data Fetching:
```javascript
// OLD (complex, error-prone):
fetch(`${API_URL}/employees`) // Then find employee in array

// NEW (direct, accurate):
fetch(`${API_URL}/points/${employee_id}`) // Get specific employee data
```

### Transaction Display:
```javascript
// NEW: Shows gift card codes
if (isRedemption && transaction.gift_card_code) {
    details = `
        <div class="mt-2 p-2 bg-light rounded">
            <strong>🎁 Gift Card Code:</strong>
            <code class="text-primary">${transaction.gift_card_code}</code>
            <strong>Value:</strong> $${points}
            <strong>Status:</strong> <span class="badge bg-success">Available</span>
        </div>
    `;
}
```

## 📊 Expected Results

## 🌐 Live Site Structure

Your mypandapoints.com appears to be separate from this GitHub repo. The updated file must be manually deployed to the live site. The file structure should be:

```
mypandapoints.com/
├── index.html (or login.html)
├── dashboard.html  ← Replace this file
├── profile.html
├── referrals.html
└── login.html
```

## 🔐 Cache Busting

The updated file includes a cache bust timestamp:
```html
<!-- Cache bust: 2025-10-10-15:30 -->
```

After deployment, users may need to:
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl+F5` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- Or clear browser cache

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Backup First**: Always backup the current dashboard.html before replacing
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Test with a real employee account (11147 works great)
3. **Cache Issues**: If changes don't appear, clear browser cache
4. **API Dependency**: Requires the Lambda function to be deployed (already done ✅)
5. **Employee ID Required**: The dashboard requires employee_id in sessionStorage

## 📞 Support

If issues persist after deployment:

1. **Check Browser Console** for errors
2. **Verify API URL**: Should be `https://dfu3zr3dnrvgiiwa2yu77cz5fq0rqmth.lambda-url.us-east-2.on.aws`
3. **Test API Endpoints** directly:
   - https://...lambda-url.../points/11147
   - https://...lambda-url.../points-history?employee_id=11147
4. **Check sessionStorage**: Should have `employeeData` with `employee_id`

## ✅ Success Criteria

Deployment is successful when:
- ✅ No console errors
- ✅ Points display correctly (85, 100, 40)
- ✅ Transaction history loads
- ✅ Gift card codes visible
- ✅ Redemption works
- ✅ Test user (11147) can see all 3 gift cards
